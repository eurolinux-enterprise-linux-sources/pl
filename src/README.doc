Building the documentation
--------------------------

Last update: Aug 12, 2008

As of SWI-Prolog 5.6.60, the generated documentation files are no longer
part of the GIT repository (see  README.git).   There  are  many ways to
access documentation:

	1) Read it online at http://www.swi-prolog.org
	2) Install a binary version
	3) Install from the release files (pl-<version>.tar,gz)

If you use GIT/CVS, you  can  download   the  generated  files  from the
http://www.swi-prolog.org/dl-stable.html  and  unpack  them    from  the
toplevel of the source.

Finally, you can build them
---------------------------

To do this:

	* Get a Unix machine, preferably Linux as most requirements are
	available by default.
	* Install Prolog, at least with the pldoc package.
	* Intall LaTeX, probably best the teTeX distribution
	(http://www.tug.org/tetex/) that comes with may Linux systems.
	* Install the plain-text conversion tools from pl/man/txt using
	the README there.
	* Build and install latex2html from packages/ltx2htm

If all that is installed correctly, it   should  be possible to generate
all documentation using the following from the toplevel:

	% make doc

Alternatively, build the system  docs  from   the  Makefile  in  the man
directory and the documentation for packages   in the package directory.
Each pachage with documentation has the make targets 'pdf' to create the
PDF docs and 'html' to create the HTML documentation.
