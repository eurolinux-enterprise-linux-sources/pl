				XPCE/SICStus Prolog

Created:	Mon Jun  7 1999

This directory contains the sources for the SICStus Prolog binding for
XPCE.

Requirements
============

	* A Unix machine with
	* SICStus Prolog 3.7.1 or later installed
	* The full XPCE source-tree including the sicstus directory

Procedure
=========

	(1) Build the XPCE library

		(a) Follow $PCEHOME/INSTALL.notes

		    This should result in $PCEHOME/<arch>/libXPCE.a

		    ====================================================
		    Bluffersguide:

		    * Make sure to have libXpm and its headers installed
		    * Make sure to have libjpeg and its headers installed
		    * % cd $PCEHOME
		      % mkdir <arch>
		      % ../src/configure
		      % make
		    ====================================================

	(2) Build the XPCE/SICStus interface:
	
		(a) Goto $PCEHOME/sicstus/src
		(b) Type

			% make

	(3) Test the base system:

			% sicstus
			?- [load].
	     
	    This should load the XPCE library *without any warnings*.
	    Run

			?- manpce.

	    A little window appears at the top-left of your screen.
	    Play around.  For example try Browsers/Class Hierarchy.

	    If everything looks healthy, continue with the next step.

	(4) Acquire rights to install in the installation directory
	    $PCEHOME (default $SP_PATH/xpce).

	(5) Install the XPCE library components in public directories

	    	% make install

	(6) Compile the .ql libraries

		% make ql

	(7) Configure the default xpce executable by editing xpce.pl
	    and run

		% make xpce

	    to create the public executable $(XPCE)

	(8) Install the result using

		% make install
