\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
XPCE is an object-management system and GUI toolkit designed for
interactive, dynamically typed languages such as Prolog and Lisp.
The C++ interface defined in this document aims at multi-lingual
applications, where C++ provides raw performance and interfacing
to external packages and an interactive symbolic language provides
the application code and development environment.

This document describes version 0.2 of the C++ interface. The reader is
supposed to be familiar with XPCE. The manual \url[Programming in
XPCE/Prolog]{http://www.swi.psy.uva.nl/projects/xpce/UserGuide/Title.html}
is a good starting point to learn about the XPCE library.
