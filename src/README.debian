Debian dependency list as compiled by Nicolas Pelletier
-------------------------------------------------------

List of packages needed to compile SWI Prolog on Debian 4.0 stable (Etch):

binutils
coreutils
gcc
grep
libc6-dev
libgmp3-dev
libncursesw5-dev
libreadline5-dev
make
sed

List of packages needed to compile additional SWI Prolog packages on
Debian 4.0 stable (Etch):

For clib: no other package required
For cpp: no other package required
For odbc: unixodbc-dev
For table: no other package required
For xpce: libxext-dev libice-dev libjpeg62-dev libxinerama-dev libxft-dev
libxpm-dev libxt-dev pkg-config
For sgml: no other package required
For sgml/RDF: no other package required
For semweb: no other package required
For http: no other package required
For chr: no other package required
For clpqr: no other package required
For nlp: no other package required
For ssl: libssl-dev
For pldoc: no other package required
For plunit: no other package required
For jpl: sun-java5-bin sun-java5-fonts sun-java5-jdk
For zlib: zlib1g-dev

Note 1: installing these packages triggers the automatic installation
of other needed (dependent) packages.
Note 2: Debian includes other Java implementations; however, the
configure script found in jpl tests for a directory structure that can
only match Sun's Java. I also do not know if the jpl package works
with these other implementations. Now that Sun has open-sourced Java,
this should be less of a concern.
