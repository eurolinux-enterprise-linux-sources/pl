SWI-Prolog on MacOS X
---------------------

SWI-Prolog is provided as a Macports  (www.macports.org/) project. It is
adviced to install Macports, after  which   you  can  install the latest
submitted port using

	% sudo port selfupdate
	% sudo port install swi-prolog

This installs the binary as /opt/local/bin/swipl   and the actual system
in /opt/local/lib/swipl-<version>

Even if you wish to install from the  source the above is recommended as
it installs all requirements on your system. Next fetch the source, copy
build.templ  to  build  and  edit  according  to  the  instructions.  In
particular, uncomment the export lines  in   this  fragment of the build
file:

# [EDIT] On MacOS you need this to get some libraries from Darwinports
# export LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/local/lib
# export CPATH=/opt/local/include
